#Dear [Muhanned],

#For the [git-workflow-workshop-for-two], we focused on implementing the main ideas around sharing a repository with a teammate to achieve the goals.
#However, we did not strictly follow the exact instructions provided.

#We will revisit the exercise again tomorrow and ensure we adhere to the detailed instructions.
